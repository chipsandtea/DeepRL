Policy Optimization
	- If we have a stochastic policy, we can smooth the optimization problem.
	- Often policy can be simpler than Q or V
		- Once you have V, you still need to know what action to take as V doesn't prescribe actions.
	- Think of policy as a function taking a state representation to probabilities of taking each action? What are the targets then? 

Likelihood Ratio Policy Gradient
	Intuition
		- Update policy by looking at a sampling of rollouts and increase probability of paths with positive R
			- Decrease paths w/ negative R
